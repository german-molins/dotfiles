# User AGENT Rules

## Development Environment

- Runtime, environment and tasks manager: `mise`

### Commands

- List all tasks: `mise tasks --extended`
- List project tasks: `mise tasks --local --extended`

## Code Style

- NEVER write code comments except very rarely for very nuanced clarifications.
- Unless otherwise stated, ALWAYS write shell scripts to be POSIX and using
shebang `#!/usr/bin/env sh`.

## Git Workflow

- ALWAYS use conventional commits with comprehensive title and detailed body.
