# My Dotfiles

Germ√°n Molins' dotfiles, managed with [`chezmoi`](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi).

## Installation

There are several installation options.

## Install with `chezmoi`

Install as

```sh
chezmoi init german-molins
```

## Install with `curl`

Run command

```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsLS get.chezmoi.io)" -- init --apply german-molins
```

## Installation Script

This installation option is very handy for tools that allow a dotfiles URL as
part of their configuration, like `devpod` or `vscode`.

Clone this repo and run the installation script,

```sh
git clone https://github.com/german-molins/dotfiles.git
dotfiles/install.sh
```

which will install the dotfiles and move the cloned repository to the default
`chezmoi` location.

## Package and Project Managers

These package managers are used to install the tools and apps at the user
level ("global"), depending on system and architecture:

- `mise`: primary global and project package manager
- `devbox`: fallback global and project package manager
- `nix`: system and user package manager
- `brew`: system package manager

Package Managers by operating system:

- macOS (ARM and AMD):
  - `mise`: tracked lock file; multi-user
  - `devbox`: tracked lock file; multi-user
  - `nix`: no tracked lock file; multi-user
  - `brew`: no tracked lock file; multi-user
- Linux AMD:
  - `mise`: tracked lock file; multi-user
  - `devbox`: tracked lock file; single-user
  - `nix`: no tracked lock file; single-user
  - `brew`: no tracked lock file; multi-user
- Linux ARM:
  - `mise`: tracked lock file; multi-user
  - `devbox`: tracked lock file; single-user
  - `nix`: no tracked lock file; single-user

Their priority order is:

1. `mise`: Primary package and project environment manager (tasks/scripts and
   environment variables)
2. `devbox`: Fallback for dependencies not found in `mise` registry
   (deprecated). Nixhub, the Devbox's registry, is way larger than any other,
so it's kept as a fallback option for packages not available in Mise,
particularly for macOS (darwin) where some packages like `eza`, `aichat`, and
`pnpm` are not supported by the Mise backends.
3. `brew` and `nix`: Used to install some user-level dependencies.
   Bootstrapping them requires sudo permissions, but once installed, the user
can use them to install packages without sudo.

### Mise

`mise` is cross-platform, and is the primary tool for both package and project
environment management (tasks/scripts and environment variables).

#### Mise Global Environment

For managing packages globally, e.g.

```sh
# Installs package globally
mise use -g fd
# Add ~/.local/config/config.{toml,lock}
chezmoi re-add
```

For packages available in the Aqua registry but not directly in Mise:

```sh
mise use -g aqua:organization/package@version
```

and

```sh
mise install
```

for installing the dependencies declared in `mise.toml` and `mise.lock`.

Update packages as

```sh
mise upgrade
```

or using the mise task:

```sh
mise run mise:update
```

Lock dependencies to specific versions:

```sh
mise run mise:lock
```

#### Project Environment

For managing a project, e.g.

```sh
cd your-project
mise use node
mise use python@3.11
git add mise.toml mise.lock
git commit -m "build: add node and python dependencies"
```

For instantiating a Mise-managed project, simply running

```sh
mise install
```

will install the dependencies declared in `mise.toml` and `mise.lock`.

#### Mise Tasks

Mise also manages tasks (scripts) that can be run with:

```sh
mise run task-name
```

To see all available tasks:

```sh
# Print list
mise tasks

# Interactize fuzzy search
mise run
```

### Devbox

`devbox` is now deprecated but kept as a fallback for packages not available in
the Mise registry, particularly for macOS (darwin) where some packages like
`eza`, `aichat`, and `pnpm` are not available for macOS in the Mise registry
backends.

#### Devbox Global Environment

For managing packages globally:

```sh
# Add a global package
devbox global add <package>

# Update global packages
devbox global update
```

The Devbox environment is automatically activated via direnv integration, so
there's no need to run `devbox shell` manually.

#### Devbox Project Environment

For managing a project with Devbox:

```sh
# Initialize a new project
cd your-project
devbox init

# Add project dependencies
devbox add <package>

# Install project dependencies
devbox install

# Update project dependencies
devbox update
```
