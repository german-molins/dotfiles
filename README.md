# My Dotfiles

Germ√°n Molins' dotfiles, managed with [`chezmoi`](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi).

## Installation

There are several installation options.

## Install with `chezmoi`

Install as

    chezmoi init german-molins

## Install with `curl`

Run command

    sh -c "$(curl -fsLS get.chezmoi.io)" -- init --apply german-molins

## Installation Script

This installation option is very handy for tools that allow a dotfiles URL as
part of their configuration, like `devpod` or `vscode`.

Clone this repo and run the installation script,

    git clone https://github.com/german-molins/dotfiles.git
    dotfiles/install.sh

which will install the dotfiles and move the cloned repository to the default
`chezmoi` location.

### Package Managers by Operating System

These package managers are used to install the tools and apps at the user
level ("global"), depending on system and architecture:

- `mise`: global and project package manager
- `devbox`: global and project package manager
- `nix`: system and user package manager
- `brew`: system package manager

Operating systems:

- macOS (ARM and AMD):
  - `mise`: tracked lock file; multi-user
  - `devbox`: tracked lock file; multi-user
  - `nix`: no tracked lock file; multi-user
  - `brew`: no tracked lock file; multi-user
- Linux AMD:
  - `mise`: tracked lock file; multi-user
  - `devbox`: tracked lock file; single-user
  - `nix`: no tracked lock file; single-user
  - `brew`: no tracked lock file; multi-user
- Linux ARM:
  - `mise`: tracked lock file; multi-user
  - `devbox`: tracked lock file; single-user
  - `nix`: no tracked lock file; single-user

Their priority order is:

1. `mise`: Main package and project environment manager
2. `devbox`: Fallback for dependencies not found in `mise` or `aqua` registry.
   Nixhub, the Devbox's registry, is way larger than any other.
3. `brew` and `nix`: Used to install some user-level dependencies.
   Bootstrapping them requires sudo permissions, but once installed, the user
can use them to install packages without sudo. `devbox` is installed by `nix`
on Linux and bootstrapped in macOS.

#### Mise

`mise` is cross-platform, and is both a package and project environment manager
(tasks/scripts and environment variables).

#### Devbox

`debbox` is a package manager that can instal packages globally (user level)
and per project. It is a very convenient manager for project shell
environments.

**Global environment**

For managing packages globally, e.g.

```sh
# Installs package and updates dependencies file and lock file.
devbox global add aider
cd "$DEVBOX_PROJECT_ROOT"
chezmoi add devbox.json devbox.lock
```

and

```sh
devbox global install
```

for installing the dependencies declared in `devbox.json` and `devbox.lock`.

Update packages as

```sh
devbox global update
```

**Project Environment**

For managing a project, e.g.

```sh
devbox init
devbox add yq
git add devbox.json devbox.lock
git commit -m "build: add package yq"
```

For instantiating a Devbox-managed project, simply running

```sh
devbox install
```

will install the dependencies declared in `devbox.json` and `devbox.lock`.
