# Git

## Aliases

Run `git alias` for a list of all aliases (it is an alias itself).

## GitFlow Branching Model

Support for the [Gitflow branching
model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) is supported
through `git flow` third-party subcommand, which Lazygit
[supports](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit?tab=readme-ov-file#git-flow-support)
if installed. This model also integrates with `git graph`.
